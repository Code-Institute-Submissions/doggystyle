Description
-----------

DoggyStyle is a website for a dog grooming company. This site showcases the clients work and offers a platform for customers to view prices and book appointments. The live site can be viewed [here](https://raymondkeogh.github.io/doggystyle/). 
This site was designed as a project to be submitted for grading in the first milestone project in Full Stack Software Development with the Code Institute.

**STRATEGY**

--------

 - Focus: The main focus of this project is to provide a portal for the
   client to increase their bookings and make it easier for
   customers to make contact.
 - Definition: We’ll be creating a website that has a very simple layout
   and, with as little effort as possible allows the users navigate and
   make contact with the business. As this may be the users first
   interaction with the business we want to present a clean, fresh and
   seamless experience. It is important to make a good first impression
   assuring the user that they are in the hands of a caring,
   professional business that will be looking after their dog.
 - Value: Creating an clean and simple portal with multiple avenues to
   initiate contact with the business should make it easier to increase
   interactions with new customers whilst increasing the profile of the
   business. This site will also offer the business a legitimate online
   location where they can direct potential clients to view their work,
   services and prices.

----------

**SCOPE**

----------

Features: 

 - Navigation menu – a simple navigation menu offering the user the
   ability to access the areas mentioned in the users, namely, Prices,
   Gallery and Contact.

 - Footer - There will be a footer containing contact detail, social links and another call to action. 
All the of the pages on the site will have the same header and footer elements, background and imagery. Once the home page is created, this template will be duplicated adding in the unique sections for each page. These will be:
 - Home pages - Sales message containing text with a button below to initiate contact. 
 - Contact pages – a contact form requesting name, email address, phone number and a comment section. 
 - Gallery - A gallery containing a selection photographs
 - Prices page - A text window on the prices pages containing the text of the business prices. 

Constraints:
Working with HTML and CSS I will be able to meet the needs of the client as well as tackling each of the scenarios in the user story effectively. However using these technologies alone will limit the site to CSS animations which will be effective but basic.

----------

**STRUCTURE**

----------

The site must be structured in a way in order to effectively achieve the clients main goal. Taking all the user stories into account it was decided that the main focuses of the site will be,


1.	Call to action – sales message with booking button.  

- As the site owner, I would like to offer a portal for clients to
book appointments.
- As the site owner, I would like to advertise my contact details and
location.
- As an external user, I want to find contact details for a dog
groomer.
- As an external user, I want to make a booking for my dog to be
groomed.

With this in mind we will focus on drawing the eye of the user to the main sales message on the home page, creating an effortless flow towards the initiation of contact. Contact details will also be available on the lower left corner and a contact button in the centre of the footer of every page. 


2.	Prices and services available.
- As the site owner, I would like to display my prices and services.
- As an external user, I want to check the prices for the grooming
services.
- As an external user, I want to see what services are offered.

The prices sections will be clearly labelled on the main page in the navigation menu and once clicked will open a clear list of services and associated prices.


 3. Evidence of work – gallery of past work.
- As an external user, I want to see examples of work done by the dog
groomer.
- As the site owner, I want to showcase the work that I do.

The gallery will be equally as visible on the main navigation menu opening up a selection of photographs for the user to scroll through. There will also be a small section on the main page that has select pictures in it. On clicking these images you will be brought to the gallery page. 

The contact page will contain a google maps iframe showing the location of the business 

- As an external user, I want to see where the dog groomers is
located.

The entire website will be optimised to be viewed on mobile devices and a variety of screen sizes.

- As an external user, I want to be able to view the site on my mobile
phone or tablet.


The overall result will be a cohesive, visually appealing and intuitive website reinforcing the clients brand image. 

- As the site owner, I want to increase the profile of my business and
have a website I can direct potential customers.

----------

**SURFACE**

----------

Given the nature of this business, image is quite important so the aesthetic of the site must reflect that. 

Colours: 

 - To achieve a fresh clean image we will be using a palette of greens
   blues, white and grey.

Typography: 

 - Holtwood One SC font is used on the main logo and will be repeated in
   the menu items in the navigation bar and Sans Serif as the backup
   font.
 - Roboto will be used for content in the main body of the page with
   Sans Serif as the backup. I chose Roboto for its clean line and as it
   pairs nicely with Holtwood One SC.

Effects:

 - To offer feedback on the buttons I will be incorporating a shadow
   effect which disappears when clicked to give the impression of a 3
   dimensional button.
 - I will also have a hover effect over the menu items in the navigation
   bar using Font Awesome icons offering the use more feedback on what
   they are about to click. This effect will be repeated in the footer element for the contact number and email address indicating that they can be interacted with.
 - The active page will also display the Font Awesome icon to indicate
   to the user which part of the site they are currently on.

Imagery: 

 - We will use an image of a field, the sky, clouds and some flowers as
   the background. This will be framed by a soft grey on the bottom and
   a white on top and will be repeated on each page. The image will be
   simple as to avoid any distraction from the main message on the page

Deviations from design:

The overall structure has remained the same however I have added a google iFrame element to the contact page showing the address and location of the business. 
On the prices page I added a second box containing services available where there was previously just a list of prices per dog.

Testing
-------

In order to comprehensively test the website, criteria for a successful launch must be established. 
1. All links on the website must connect to the correct location. 
2. All images and elements on website must load correctly. 
3. All fallback fonts must work visually should the first choice fonts be unavailable. 
4. All elements on the website must be responsive, resizing for different screen sizes and maintaining their integrity with no overlapping. 
5. All photos in gallery must be clickable, expand to full size and be closable. This must be achievable in both desktop and mobile screen layouts. They must also respond to hover by expanding by 1.2x their original size. The photos should also have an arrow for scrolling through the gallery in fullscreen.
6. All external links direct to the correct website.
7. The website loads correctly and functions on Chrome, Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox browsers.
8. The website performs as required as outlined in User Stories for external users and the site owner.

Bug: Contact button in footer covers the Phone number and email section when screen goes below 578px.<br>
Fix: set contact details to display:none as the footer was too cluttered. 

Bug: I initially used bootsraps buttons but had issues with specificity and applying styles
to the class I created for button. <br>

copying the bootstrap button parameters and styling my own button in order create the 3d click effect using box-shadow and display properties.

Fix: Moved the footer into a div and gave the div class ".container-fluid"

Bug: The footer is jumping up when reducing the screen size. <br>
Fix: I had erroneously put a media query in 'table screen size' section. Footer fine once code removed.

Bug: After W3 Validation for CSS and HTML the gallery navigation and close buttons are missing.<br>
Fix: I had somehow deleted the script link for lightbox. 

Bug: After W3 Validation for CSS and HTML I changed a button inside a anchor tag to a form to pass the validation. The buttons did not click through to link.<br>
